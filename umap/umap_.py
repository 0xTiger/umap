    """Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection

    Finds a low dimensional embedding of the data that approximates
    an underlying manifold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors: int (optional, default 50)
        The size of local neighborhood (in terms of number of neighboring
        sample points) used for manifold approximation. Larger values
        result in more global views of the manifold, while smaller
        values result in more local data being preserved. In general
        values should be in the range 10 to 100.

    n_components: int (optional, default 2)
        The dimension of the space to embed into. This defaults to 2 to
        provide easy visualization, but can reasonably be set to any
        integer value in the range 2 to 100.

    gamma: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Weighting applied to negative samples in low dimensional embedding
        optimization. Values higher than one will result in greater weight
        being given to negative samples.

    n_edge_samples: int (optional, default None)
        The number of edge/1-simplex samples to be used in optimizing the
        low dimensional embedding. Larger values result in more accurate
        embeddings. If None is specified a value will be selected based on
        the size of the input dataset (typically around dataset_size * 10**4).

    alpha: float (optional, default 1.0)
        The initial learning rate for the embedding optimization.

    init: string (optional, default 'spectral')
        How to initialize the low dimensional embedding. Options are:
            * 'spectral': use a spectral embedding of the fuzzy 1-skeleton
            * 'random': assign initial emebdding positions at random.

    min_dist: float (optional, default 0.25)
        The effective minimum distance between embedded points. Smaller values
        will result in a more clustered/clumped embedding where nearby points
        on the manifold are drawn closer together, while larger values will
        result on a more even dispersal of points. The value should be set
        relative to the ``spread`` value, which determines the scale at which
        embedded points will be spread out.

    spread: float (optional, default 1.0)
        The effective scale of embedded points. In combination with ``min_dist``
        this determines how clustered/clumped the embedded points are.

    a: float (optional, default None)
        More specific parameters controlling the embedding. If None these
        values are set automatically as determined by ``min_dist`` and
        ``spread``.
    b: float (optional, default None)
        More specific parameters controlling the embedding. If None these
        values are set automatically as determined by ``min_dist`` and
        ``spread``.

    oversampling: int (optional, default 3)
        The scaling factor for the number of neighbors to sample to attempt
        to find the local neighborhood in manifold distance. If set to be too
        large this can have a significant negative impact on performance.
